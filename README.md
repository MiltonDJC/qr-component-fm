## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most important thing I learned was to control the size of the elements using absolute measurements instead of relative measurements. When I used relative measurements, it was difficult to control the sizes of the container and the position of the elements.

### Continued development

For futures project I want to get better using relative measurements.
